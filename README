Simple clean code 
and unit tests

Just show my skils.

Task:

ANAGRAM
Write an application that reverses all the words of input text: 
Example "abcd efgh" => "dcba hgfe" 

All non-letter symbols should stay on the same places:

Example "a1bcd efg!h" => "d1cba hgf!e" 
Use Latin alphabet for test only.

You should write a function which returns reverse text

UNITTESTS

Code should be covered by tests over 80 percent. For measuring code coverage use package these https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/

Your tests should also check for other cases, for example, what happens if a number is passed to your function. You should modify your function for atypical behaviors.
